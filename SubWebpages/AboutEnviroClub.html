    <main>
        <p>Welcome to the EnviroClub, where we believe that small actions can lead to big changes in protecting and preserving our planet. Our club is a vibrant
             community of passionate individuals dedicated to raising awareness, promoting sustainability, and taking tangible steps to create a greener, more eco-conscious world.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Our Mission</strong>
            <br>
            The EnviroClub was founded with the simple but powerful goal of making a positive impact on our environment. Our 2025 Captain, Thandolwethu Myeza, 
            wishes for the club to be a safe space where people can foster a deeper connection with nature and promote sustainable living through engaging 
            activities such as thrift events, beach cleanups, and educational experiences like birdwatching. Together, we aim to empower students and inspire 
            positive environmental change to protect our planet for future generations.
            <br><br>
        <strong>Goals:</strong>
        <br>
            Educate our community about the pressing environmental challenges we face.<br>
            Inspire action through hands-on projects and initiatives.<br>
            Promote sustainability in all aspects of life, from reducing waste to conserving resources.<br>
            Collaborate with local organizations and other groups to amplify our impact.
            <br><br>
        <strong>What We Do</strong>
        <br>
            At the EnviroClub, we are committed to taking action on a variety of environmental issues, including climate change, waste reduction, 
            biodiversity conservation, and sustainable living. Our members engage in activities such as:
            <br>
            Organizing recycling and waste reduction campaigns/events.<br>
            Planting trees and creating green spaces.<br>
            Running fundraising efforts for environmental causes (last year we adopted penguins!).<br>
            Participating in local clean-up projects.<br>
            We also use our platform to raise awareness about global and local environmental issues, encouraging individuals to make informed decisions and adopt sustainable practices.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why It Matters</strong>
            <br>
            Our planet is facing unprecedented challenges, from climate change and deforestation to pollution and loss of biodiversity. The time to act is now, and we believe that together,
             we can make a difference. By joining the EnviroClub, you become part of a collective effort to protect the Earth for future generations. Whether through small daily actions or 
             larger initiatives, every step counts in the fight for a healthier planet. <br>
             Our 2025 Vice-Captain, Saskia Pillay, still vividly remembers her first birdwatching walk and "the unforgettable 
             feeling of being surrounded by a diverse and life-filled ecosystem, while breathing in its fresh air."
             She also loves sharing stories about beach clean-ups and how it was "an eye-opening experience to see just how much plastic and litter there was." <br> Our planet is in desperate need of help and there can "never be too many helping hands". We assure you, everything you do matters.
             <br><br>
            <strong>Join Us</strong>
            <br>

            sustainability, we welcome you to join our community. <br> And as we always say, while the environment is at the heart of the EnviroClub, 
            it's the people and the hilarious and heartfelt moments that truly make the club come alive. <br> Join us and together we can create a brighter, greener future for our planet.
